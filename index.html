    <h1>Semantic Tags</h1>
<p>Semantic tags clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. They tell both the browser and the developer what kind of content is inside the tag. These tags improve the accessibility and SEO of a webpage because search engines can better understand the structure and content of the page.</p>
Examples of semantic tags:
<br>
header: Represents the introductory content or a group of navigational links.
<br>nav: Represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page, typically for navigation menus.
<br>article: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be independently distributed or reused, like a blog post or a news article.
<br>section: Defines a section in a document, typically with a heading.
<br>aside: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, like a sidebar.
<br>footer: Represents the footer of a document or a section, usually containing copyright information, links, or other metadata.
<br>main: Represents the dominant content of the "body" of a document.
<h1>Non-Semantic Tags:</h1>
<p>Non-semantic tags do not clearly describe their content. They are often used purely for styling or layout purposes rather than for describing content. These tags are less informative for search engines and screen readers because they don't convey any meaning about the content they enclose.</p>
Examples of non-semantic tags:

<br>div: A generic container for grouping and styling purposes. It doesn't tell anything about the content inside it.
<br>span: An inline container used to group text for styling purposes. Like "div", it doesn’t provide any semantic meaning.

        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. 
        It provides the basic structure of a webpage by using a series of elements or tags, which define the content and layout.
        These tags are enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., `tagname`), and each serves a specific purpose, such as:
        </div>
        <div>
            -**`html`**: Defines the root of an HTML document.
        </div>
        <div>
            - **`meta`**: Defines metadata about the document.
        </div>
        <div>
            - **`head`**: Contains meta-information about the document, such as its title and links to stylesheets.
        </div>
        <div>
            - **`title`**: Sets the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab.
        </div>
        <div>  
            - **`body`**: Contains the actual content of the webpage, such as text, images, links, and other elements.
        </div>
        <div>
            - **`h1 to h6`**: Define headings, with `h1` being the highest level and `h6` the lowest.
        </div>
        <div>
            - **`p`**: Defines a paragraph.
        </div>
        <div>
            - **`a`**: Defines a hyperlink.
        </div>
        <div>
            - **`img`**: Embeds an image in the document.
        </div>
        <div>
            - **`div`**: Defines a division or a section in the document, often used for layout purposes.
        </div>
        <div>
            - **`span`**: Defines a section in a document, typically used to apply styles to a small part of the content.
        </div>
        
        HTML is not a programming language but a markup language, meaning it is used to "mark up" text to structure and format web pages. HTML works hand in hand with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. 
        
        Web browsers read HTML files and render them into visual or audible web pages that users can interact with.</p>
